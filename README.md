# ForbidURLs
Regular-expression based URL blocking extension for Chrome

Allows blocking of any URL based on regular expression patterns, so you can prevent webpages, popups, scripts, images, stylesheets, etcetera not just by domain name but by partial pattern matches as well

Additionally provides a list of URLs encountered but not blocked and a quick button for adding each URL's domain to the block list so you don't have to type it up manually.
